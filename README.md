### assets 
  * 3 folders in here: fonts, icons and images

### components 
  * This is where we place all our shared React components. Usually these components are the ones that we call “dummy”, that have no state logic and can be easily reused across the app.

### views 
  * These are our application screens, the ones that we navigate from one to another. These are also React components, but they are the ones that we call containers, because they contain their own state.
### services 
  *  These are the functions that wrap the API calls.
